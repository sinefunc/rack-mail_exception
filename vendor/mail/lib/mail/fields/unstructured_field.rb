  # Provides access to an unstructured header field

  # ===Per RFC 2822:
  #  2.2.1. Unstructured Header Field Bodies
  #  
  #     Some field bodies in this standard are defined simply as
  #     "unstructured" (which is specified below as any US-ASCII characters,
  #     except for CR and LF) with no further restrictions.  These are
  #     referred to as unstructured field bodies.  Semantically, unstructured
  #     field bodies are simply to be treated as a single line of characters
  #     with no further processing (except for header "folding" and
  #     "unfolding" as described in section 2.2.3).

    # 2.2.3. Long Header Fields
    # 
    #  Each header field is logically a single line of characters comprising
    #  the field name, the colon, and the field body.  For convenience
    #  however, and to deal with the 998/78 character limitations per line,
    #  the field body portion of a header field can be split into a multiple
    #  line representation; this is called "folding".  The general rule is
    #  that wherever this standard allows for folding white space (not
    #  simply WSP characters), a CRLF may be inserted before any WSP.  For
    #  example, the header field:
    #  
    #          Subject: This is a test
    #  
    #  can be represented as:
    #  
    #          Subject: This
    #           is a test
    #  
    #  Note: Though structured field bodies are defined in such a way that
    #  folding can take place between many of the lexical tokens (and even
    #  within some of the lexical tokens), folding SHOULD be limited to
    #  placing the CRLF at higher-level syntactic breaks.  For instance, if
    #  a field body is defined as comma-separated values, it is recommended
    #  that folding occur after the comma separating the structured items in
    #  preference to other places where the field could be folded, even if
    #  it is allowed elsewhere.
